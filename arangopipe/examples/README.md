## Example Notebooks

These examples jupyter notebooks illustrate some features of **Arangopipe** with common machine learning project activities:

1. [Basic workflow](https://github.com/arangoml/arangopipe/blob/master/examples/Arangopipe_Feature_Examples.ipynb) of creating a project and tracking machine learning meta-data from project activity.

2. An example of [connecting](https://github.com/arangoml/arangopipe/blob/master/examples/Reuse_Old_Arangopipe_Connection.ipynb) to the **Arangopipe** database created in the previous step using saved connection information.
3. An example of using **Arangopipe** to track [covariate shift](https://github.com/arangoml/arangopipe/blob/master/examples/Arangopipe_Feature_ext2.ipynb)

4. An example of using **Arangopipe** to document and capture meta-data from machine learning [experiments](https://github.com/arangoml/arangopipe/blob/master/examples/Arangopipe_Feature_Example_ext1.ipynb).

5. An example of [linking](https://github.com/arangoml/arangopipe/blob/master/examples/Data_Summaries.ipynb) metadata from different project activities.
