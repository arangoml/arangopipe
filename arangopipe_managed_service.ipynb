    "Connecting to a managed database instance of ArangoDB is done using the ArangoPipeAdmin component. The first time you connect to a managed service database, you will need to provide the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The host name associated with the managed database service\n",
    "2.  The web service endpoint for the managed database service (default value is apmdb)\n",
    "3.  The name of the service that provisions a managed database service (default value is createDB)\n",
    "4. The port to be used for the managed database service (default value is 8529)\n",
    "5. The connection protocol to be used for interacting with the service (http/https)\n",
    "6. Managed service databases are recycled periodically. If you wish to be be notified prior to such a recycling event associated with you database instance for the purpose of backing up your data, you can provide an email address for this purpose. Note: The web service end point and the name of the service that provisions a managed database service are advanced configuration parameters that you would typically not need to change.\n",
    "The above connection information is provided through the ArangopipeConfig object. Once a connection to a managed service instance is obtained by ArangoPipe, it is perisisted for reuse. The next time you want to connect to the last used database, simply instantiate an instance of ArangoPipeAdmin and obtain the saved configuration information. If you have not used your managed service instance for a while, then it may have been recycled. If you attempt to connect to a recycled database instance, you will receive an exception. You may then connect to a new ArangoPipe database by providing a set of connection parameters. These ideas are illustrated below"
