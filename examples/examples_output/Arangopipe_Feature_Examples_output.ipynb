        "# ArangoML Part 2: Basic Arangopipe Workflow\n",
        "This post is the second in a series of posts about machine learning and showcasing the benefits ArangoML adds to your machine learning pipelines. In this post we:\n",
        " - Introduce machine learning concepts\n",
        " - Demonstrate basic model building\n",
        " - Log a model building activity with arangopipe\n",
        "\n",
        "These posts will hopefully appeal to two audiences:\n",
        " - The first half of each post is for beginners in machine learning\n",
        " - The second half for those already using machine learning\n",
        "\n",
        "We decided to do it this way to try and provide a jumping off point for those interested in machine learning, while still showing useful examples for those that already have a machine learning pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Intro\n",
        "The primary objective of these posts is to showcase the benefits of using ArangoML. However, a secondary objective is to introduce machine learning concepts to those just starting their machine learning journey. They aren’t meant to be an exhaustive explanation of every concept but a short intro to the most relevant concepts for each post.\n",
        "\n",
        "This post focuses on how you can use arangopipe throughout a machine learning project to capture meta-data. Since this example is meant to show how to use arangopipe throughout your entire project, attempting to cover all the concepts mentioned is well outside the scope of this post. Instead, it focuses on model building.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is model building?\n",
        "A key goal of machine learning is to build applications that can analyze data to make predictions about data that is supplied to it in the future. Such as the scenario we will use for a few of the posts in this series, predicting house prices. There are machine learning use cases in nearly every aspect of our daily lives:\n",
        " - Voice Assistants (Siri, Alexa, etc..)\n",
        " - Recommendation Engines\n",
        " - Image Recognition\n",
        " - Fraud Detection\n",
        " - Email Filtering\n",
        " - So many more!\n",
        "\n",
        "There are quite a few steps involved in creating an application that can learn from data and then make accurate predictions about other data. One of the first tasks in developing machine learning models is to understand the characteristics of the data as they pertain to the model development task at hand.One of the steps involves creating or choosing from algorithms and then testing how it behaves against your data. In order for our application to be able to determine what a house will cost, it needs to be trained with example data. This data is usually labeled to provide clues that normally wouldn’t exist in the data, such as the prices of the houses that the application will eventually learn to predict. "

There is a phenomenon called [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting) where a machine learning model could potentially ‘memorize’ the data in a dataset and this is why we split the dataset. Once split we can test the model against the test data to confirm it is performing as good as it was on the training data.\n",

Model selection is an important activity for data scientists. Data scientists consider many candidate models for a task and then the best performing model is chosen. An example of this can be found in the hyperopt guide to capture metadata from a hyper-parameter tuning experiment, (see [hyperopt](https://github.com/arangoml/arangopipe/blob/master/arangopipe/tests/hyperopt/hyperopt_integration.ipynb)). We will use a simpler setting for this notebook. We will assume model selection has been completed and that a LASSO regression model is the best candidate for the task. Having made this decision, we capture information about the model and its parameters. This information is stored in Arangopipe. The details of performing these tasks are shown below. Before model building, we capture information related to the dataset and the features used to build the model."
