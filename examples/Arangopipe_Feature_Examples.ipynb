    "In this section, the details of capturing meta-data with Arangopipe as part of model building activity will be illustrated. Model selection is an important activity for data scientists. Data scientists consider many candidate models for a task. The best performing model is then chosen. This procedure is illustrated in the notebook illustrating the use of hyperopt to capture meta data from a hyper-parameter tuning experiment, (see [hyperopt.](https://github.com/arangoml/arangopipe/blob/master/arangopipe/tests/hyperopt/hyperopt_integration.ipynb)). We will use a simpler setting for this notebook. We will assume model selection has been completed and that a LASSO regression model is the best candidate for the task. Having made this decision, we capture information about the model and its parameters. This information is stored in Arangopipe. The details of performing these tasks are shown below. Before model building, we capture information related to the dataset and the features used to build the model.\n"
